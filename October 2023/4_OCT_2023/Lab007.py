# Variables
# Store the values
# A containers
# name = "Pramod"
# container with the name name , and value is Pramod
# variable Name should be unique
# There are 3 types of variables based on data type used to declare the variable
# 1) Numbers, 2) Strings,3) Boolean

name = "Pramod"
print(name)
name2 = "Amit"
print(name2)

# String - Bunch of Character ( join two or more char - String "" - str
# Char - A,B,C, D AND a,b,c,d,  "$"
# !@#$%^&*

# Data Types in Python
#Numbers : the following 1,2,3,4,5 are the Data Types in Python .
# 1) Integers - Positive and negative whole numbers.
# 2) Floating Points Numbers
# 3) Complex Numbers
# 4) Strings, Lists,  Tuples, Dictionaries, Booleans
# 5) Sets

x = 5 # x is an integer type -> int => Data Type as Integer Type
print(type(x))

print(type(name))



# int a = 5; - Data Type in Java before even creating a variable name
a = 5  # int

pi = 3.14 # float => Data Type as Float
name = "Pramod" # str => Data Tpye as String
isMale = True # bool => Data Type as Booleans

print(type(isMale))

# Numbers - int, float
# Strings - str
# Booleans - bool

cn = 3+4j # complex
# j = imaginary
print(cn)
print(type(cn))


# Complex Number - ?
# List, Tuples, Dic, Set

# Data Sceinece, Math, ML AI - they need iota
